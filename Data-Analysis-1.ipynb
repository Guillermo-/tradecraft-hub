That is, instead of bucket-tizing the data into similar bins based on a bin-range and placing them in a Histogram, the ECDF helps us visualize the raw data across its range of values. In our case below, we show the raw values for each feature. \n",

For example, in the chart below about 67% of the values for remote access are less than or equal to 0, whereas for all other features they are about 55%-to-60% less than or equal to 0. \n",

    "Along the diagnal, this tells us each feature's distribution relative to the go/no-go criterion. For example, the comms feature has two clear distributions; the blue hill represents the comms feature's contribution to go criterion examples, whereas the red hill represents its contributions to the no-go criterion. In my experience, the more distinct (or separated) the 2 hills are the better if we have 2 outcomes we are classifying (i.e. the go/no-go criterion). If we had 3 outcomes, such as \"go,\" \"no-go,\" and \"standby,\" then it's better to see 3 separated distributions. \n",

For example, under the comms column and remote access row, this tells informs us how well (or not) these two feaures do at distinguishing a go criterion (in blue) from no-go criterion (in orange). \n",

    "So in my experience, the more a pair of features can separate the classification indicates that these features are the more likely these to features will be informative to the ML model, and less likely noise within our dataset -- again, relative to the classification (e.g. go/no-go criterion). For example, we see that the comms feature, paired with other features, tends to do pretty well at separating the two classification. On the other hand, we see that the weather feature, regardless of pairing, struggles to separate the two classifications (e.g. go/no-go criterion).\n",
